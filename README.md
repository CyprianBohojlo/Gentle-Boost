# Gentle-Boost

In this university project, I manually implement from scratch a Gentle Boost algorithm using Numpy library only. Gentle Boost is a variant of AdaBoost that’s designed to be more stable and less sensitive to noisy data or outliers.

Finally, I test the algorithm on USPS digit recogniction data. The dataset consits of many variants of handwritten digits such as the ones presented below. The algorithm's goal is to recognize the digit written and classify it correctly.
